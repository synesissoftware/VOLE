 * fixed defects in conversions to int/long/float/double
 * other minor fixes
 * now compatible with VC++ 8+'s "safe string" library
 * various documentation markup changes


19th June 2009 - 0.6.4 released
-------------------------------

 * corrects defect in default constructor, whereby coercion level parameter, if specified, is ignored


13th May 2009 - 0.6.3 released
------------------------------

 * invocation_exception now passes through the underlying scode when DISP_E_EXCEPTION


15th Sep 2008 - 0.6.2 released
------------------------------

 * fixed defect in com_return_traits<object>::convert()
 * fixed defect in assertion in GetIDOfName()'s thrown exception
 * fixed up various examples to use 3-parameter create() method


12th Sep 2008 - 0.6.1 released
------------------------------

 * added return traits specialisations for DATE, FILETIME and SYSTEMTIME
 * documentation improvements


6th Sep 2008 - 0.5.2 released
-----------------------------

 * changed the way vole::collection::get__NewEnum() works: it now makes two
   attempts to elicit the enumerator, first via DISPATCH_PROPERTYGET and

   not freed
 * collection::Invoke() now uses the EXCEPINFO information when throwing an
   exception
 * enhanced vole::invocation_exception ctor to take pointer to EXCEPINFO as
   (optional) third parameter. If an exception information pointer is
   passed, then exception info result code takes preference if the 'outer'

   preference to the system message for the result code

   com_return_traits<int>, com_return_traits<long>,
   com_return_traits<std::string> and com_return_traits<std::wstring>
 * added test.unit.return_traits.builtins
