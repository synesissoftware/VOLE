==============================

 + include/vole/return_traits/time_types.hpp:
     + com_return_traits<date_t> (which retrieves DATE values)

    ~ now uses the EXCEPINFO information when throwing an exception

 ~ vole/error/exceptions.hpp:
    ~ enhanced vole::invocation_exception ctor to take pointer to EXCEPINFO
      as (optional) third parameter. If an exception information pointer is
      passed, then exception info result code takes preference if the
      'outer' code is DISP_E_EXCEPTION, and the the description (if any) is
      used in preference to the system message for the result code

23rd Aug 2008 - 0.5.1 released

 ~ changed behaviour of com_return_traits<int> as follows:
    + added conversion, at coercion level of naturalPromotion, from
      VT_INT

      VT_INT
    + added conversion, at coercion level of nonDestructiveCoercion, from
      VT_UINT, VT_EMPTY and VT_NULL

 ~ changed behaviour of com_return_traits<std::string> and
   com_return_traits<std::wstring> as follows:
    ~ now only invokes VariantChangeType() if coercion level is
      nonDestructiveCoercion or higher
    ~ allows value property conversion only if coercion level is
      valueCoercion
    + added conversion from VT_ERROR to look up error code string

   com_return_traits<long>::convert(), whereby any value outside the range
   of a short was truncated.

 ~ requires STLSoft 1.9.45 (http://stlsoft.org/)


13th Apr 2008 - 0.4.1 released
==============================

 ~ refactoring of exception hierarchy - now all are implemented as distinct
   classes, rather than as typedefs (to vole::vole_exception)

8th Apr 2008 - 0.3.3 released
=============================

6th April 2007 - 0.2.2
======================

 ~ vole::collection constructors now take coercion_level parameter

 ~ vole::collection::operator []() now attempts both retrieval (of
   DISPID_VALUE) as a property and, if that fails, as a method. This caters
   for either implementation, and therefore covers all cases of "Item"
   members.

 + vole::object::is_nothing() method

 + vole::object::get() method

 + vole::object::lcid() method

 + vole::object::QueryInterface() method overloads

 ~ GetIDOfName() now reports the missing member name as part of the
   exception in the case where GetIDsOfNames() returns DISP_E_UNKNOWNNAME.

 + vole::object overload of STLSoft is_null() logical shim

 + vole::object overload of STLSoft get_ptr() attribute shim

 + vole::com_return_traits<bool> specialisation (for Boolean returns)


21st January 2007 - 0.2.1
=========================

This is the first public release, including support for
properties (get_ and put_) and methods, but not
including support for named arguments.
